SIMULATION (ignore if you arent going to sim)

3. verify gcc and g++ version with: "gcc --version" and "g++ --version"
4. if it says "g++ is not a command" or some shit then do whats below (you need to edit the system environment variable)
5. locate the binary folder in the .zip file for g++, it should be something like C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin     copy this into ur clipboard
6. go into control panel (if on windows) and search for "system environment variable" or just search it in the start menu

BAUD CONFIG
1. to find your baud rate, go into cmd and type "mode"
2. baud should be the first item on the list.
3. if the stated baud is 1200, i have already set that as the default, but it is EXTREMELY slow
4. to change your baud, type "mode COM1 baud=9600 parity=n data=8 stop=1"
5. this also aligns with n81 stuff
6. then, in RobotContainer.cpp, change Serial.begin(DEF_BAUD) to Serial.begin(WIN_BAUD)
7. u good to go
